### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I thought this challenge was going to be easy, but I was wrong. The only place that tripped me was setting background image. I just couldn't get it to work.
After looking for some help at FM's discord, I found a link to [@grace-snow](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/grace-snow) solution. And here is where I learned about using pseudo elements `::after` and `::before` for setting background images.

### Continued development

Pseudo elements are really useful. Would start exloring how other dev's make use of them.

What I learned and needed help with was the background images. I tried, but couldn't get it to work. So I searched FM's discord for some help or inspiration and I found @grace-snow comment with link to their take on this challenge.
It was really helpful. I learned something new.
